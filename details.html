    <p><strong>What is Treaty 1?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treaty 1 was made in <strong>1871</strong>.</li>
        <li>It was an agreement between the <strong>Canadian government</strong> and several <strong>First Nations</strong>.</li>
        <li>The First Nations lived in <strong>Manitoba</strong> for many years before Europeans arrived.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Who Was Involved in Treaty 1?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seven First Nations groups signed Treaty 1:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brokenhead</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sagkeeng</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Long Plain</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Peguis</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Roseau River</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sandy Bay</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Swan Lake</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li>These First Nations are part of the <strong>Anishinaabe</strong> (Ojibway) and <strong>Cree</strong> peoples.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why Was Treaty 1 Made?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Canadian government wanted to use the land for <strong>farms</strong> and <strong>towns</strong>.</li>
        <li>In exchange, they promised to help the First Nations by:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Giving them <strong>land</strong> to live on (called <strong>reserves</strong>).</li>
            <li>Providing them with <strong>money</strong> every year.</li>
            <li>Helping them <strong>farm</strong> by giving tools, animals, and seeds.</li>
            <li>Allowing them to <strong>hunt and fish</strong> on the land.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What Did the First Nations Think?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The First Nations thought they were <strong>sharing</strong> the land with settlers.</li>
        <li>The Canadian government thought they were <strong>taking</strong> the land.</li>
        <li>This caused problems because the First Nations didn't get everything they were promised.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why is Treaty 1 Important?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treaty 1 shows how people tried to <strong>work together</strong>.</li>
        <li>Today, First Nations are still working with the government to ensure the promises of Treaty 1 are <strong>kept</strong>.</li>
        <li>Many places where people live today, like <strong>Winnipeg</strong>, are on <strong>Treaty 1 land</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <strong>Crown</strong>, <strong>Anishinaabe</strong>, <strong>Swampy Cree</strong>, and <strong>Canada's First Nations</strong> communities are involved in the Treaty 1 territory.</p>
